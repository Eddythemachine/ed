Functional components
Do not go similiar methods and hooks that replicate class components
There are no life cycles when we come to functional components
Here we use the concept of functions and side effects

What are SIDE EFFECTS?
Pure functions and impure functions

A pure function return the exact same thing no matter how many times it is called
const pureFunction = (a,b){
  return a+b
};

Impure functions
let c = 20;
const impureFunction = function(a,b){
  return a+b+c;
};

Using hooks, first you need to import the hooks
import {useState} from 'react';
